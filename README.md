- **Dataset Used**
    - District-wise, season-wise crop production statistics
    - [Link](https://data.gov.in/catalog/district-wise-season-wise-crop-production-statistics?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=87631&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc)
- **Scatter Plot**
    - Plotted Total Crop Production per State vs Crop Covered Area (Data of 2012)
    - Found a positive co-relation between them.
    - There were two outliers which were manually removed from data to visualize the plot properly.
    - After removing outliers we can clearly see that production is linearly dependent on area. Specifically I have also plotted y=5x on the same graph to visualize it properly.
- **Box Plot**
    - Plotted 5 States Yearly Production of Coconut to visualize how yearly production of coconut is distributed.
    - This graph shows that even though States like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Goa are small in area they have higher production of Coconuts than States like Karnataka and West Bengal.
- **Bar Plot**
    - Plotted Rice production per state.
    - In the given plot states are arranged in descending order of crop covered area.
    - We can observe from this plot that production of Rice is mainly done by 13 states and rest all other combined produce less.
